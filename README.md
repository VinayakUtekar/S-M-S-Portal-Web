The Java Web-based Student Management System is a feature-rich project designed to simplify and enhance the management of student records in educational institutions through a web application. This project utilizes JavaServer Pages (JSP) for creating dynamic web pages and SQL for seamless database connectivity and data operations. With this web application, administrators can efficiently manage student information, academic records, and other essential data, making administrative tasks more streamlined and accessible from any web-enabled device.

Features:

JavaServer Pages (JSP) for Dynamic Web Pages: The project utilizes JSP, a technology that enables the creation of dynamic web pages in Java. JSP allows for the integration of Java code directly into HTML, enabling the application to generate dynamic content based on user input and database queries.

Student Data Management: The Student Management System allows administrators to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on student records. Through the web application, administrators can add new students, view existing records, update information, and delete student entries as needed. The dynamic web pages ensure a smooth and interactive user experience.

Academic Records Management: The system includes functionality to manage academic records such as grades, attendance, and other academic-related data. Administrators can input and access student academic data through the web application. This feature provides valuable insights into student performance and aids educators in making data-driven decisions.

Database Connectivity using SQL: To ensure secure data storage and seamless data operations, the web application integrates SQL for database connectivity. The application establishes a connection with the database to store and retrieve student information and academic records. SQL enables efficient querying and management of the database.
